<h1>Monty Hall Simulation</h1>

The Monty Hall paradox is a classic problem in probability theory where Monty, a game show host shows three doors to a player. Behind one of the three doors is a car, and behind the rest of the two doors is nothing. The player first chooses any one of the three doors but does not open it. Then, Monty opens one of the remaining doors that is non-winning. The player is then given an option to switch to the remaining unopened door, or stick to the door that he chose in the beginning of the game. The argument is that it is a good strategy for the player to switch. 

The following is a simulation of the Monty Hall paradox. Random numbers are generated using the default uniformly distributed random number generator.</p>
